This is the README of DIGI_NED for DOS and Linux

To compile DIGI_NED for DOS unpack the source in the directory C:\APRS\, then
use de IDE of BORLAND C++ 3.0 to compile. If another directory is used then
the project file needs to be setup again.

To compile for Linux any directory can be used. See directions in
digi_ned.txt on how to compile DIGI_NED for Linux.

The directory "Distrib" contains some scripts used to generate a DOS
distribution, the batch-files where used with 4DOS and will not work
with COMMAND.COM. Also the InfoZip "zip" program should be present in
the PATH.

The directory "ax25_mac" contains the source of the MAC layer driver, only
used for DOS. It is compiled using MSVC++ 1.5 and MASM 5.0; use nmake to
compile.

The directory "sample" contains demonstration programs used with the
sample digi_ned.mes.

DIGI_NED is "free" software as defined in the GNU General Public Licence,
see COPYING for details.

                   "Sattrack.doc" and a lot of the commenttext in
                   "digi_ned.ini" will vanish. Extract using InfoZip's
                   "unzip" or any other unzipper that preserves directories
                   and understands long filenames.

The runtime parts for LINUX are:

DON'T FORGET TO EDIT "digibcon.ini" AND "digi_id.ini" TO CHANGE TE POSITION
TO WHERE YOU LIVE AND TO YOUR CALL!
(Strange stations seem to appear in my home-town...).

Also you most likely want to change "digi_ned.mes" to reflect the
situation in your area...
