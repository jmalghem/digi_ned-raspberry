This file is to list and remember the existing ideas for development. Some
day some of them will be implemented. Some sooner, some later...

Just started this, probably forgot 50% or more but will add it when it pops
up again...

- Add member feature. Members may send some commands
- Hold-of digipeating to see if another digipeater already repeated it.
  Usefull when you have 2 digis close together, a main and a backup digi
  for the packets that the main digi missed.
- Add color output
- Selective logfile, do not log everything - only APRS data
- Remote control of a receiver for remote direction finder
- Add different MAC layer driver for FlexNet
- Extendable user add-on telemetry sources using TSR's
- Statistics for nr of repeated frames, number of dupes, poweruser
- Weedout of junk BLN postings (allow 1 BLN per user for example...)
- APRS frame integrity checking (add Ian's decoder to detect faulty
  packets).
- Make function keys in DOS work, attach user defined commands to them
  (make F1 work as help)
- Make a kind of bulletin mechanism. Somebody sends a message to the digi
  for another station. The message is queued in the digi. As soon as
  the other station is heard the message is forwarded to him. It will
  this way act as a primitive mailbox.
- Add DXPlot function, have your DX station plotted on the map
- Add trimX operation, keep arbitrary number of digipeaters and replace
  the rest.
- Telemetry transmission when the input changes. For analog signals
  add thresholds.
- Some replies to queries are hard-coded in english, it would be nice
  if someone could change it to another language without changeing the
  code.
- Don't send beacons directly after startup but after the interval period
- Add a command to temporarly add one or more callsigns to the block list
  or to remotely manage the block list.
- Add new generic calls LOCAL, REGION, IGATE and WORLD when there is some
  consensus reached in the discussions on the APRS SIG (at www.tapr.org).
- Use of different call for each port
- Add "routing" for messages, only send messages to the port were the user
  is heard.
- Add setting to digipeat to port in 3rd party format.
